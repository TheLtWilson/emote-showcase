This is a Twitch extension panel that integrates with first and third party services including Twitch, BetterTTV, FrankerFaceZ, and 7TV.

## I am not a professional.
I do not know what I'm doing 99.9% of the time, if something could be done more efficiently, please do so!

## Note:
The way Twitch extensions interface with Twitch, the only way to test your panel is through the [extension developer rig](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/extensions/rig) or via adding the test version of the extension to your own Twitch page.
