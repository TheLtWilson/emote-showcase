Lt. Wilson's Emote Showcase is an extensive and customizable showcase for all of your emotes. This extension has support for not only your own channel emotes, but also for third-party services such as BetterTTV, FrankerFaceZ, and 7TV. This extension also displays info about the emote, such as the uploader for emotes on third-party services.

Includes support for channel follower emotes, subscriber emotes, animated emotes, BetterTTV channel emotes, BetterTTV shared emotes, FrankerFaceZ emotes, and 7TV emotes.

## üëá Current Features

These describe the current feature set of the extension, these will be updated to reflect any planned updates that are added.

- Showcase all emoticons, even from third-party services.
- Ability to display different channel emote types (tier 1, bits, etc.) separately.
- Provide basic details pertaining to certain emoticons.
- Direct link to access and add a third-party emoticon to your channel.

## ‚è∞ Planned Updates

These are updates of varying priority that are planned to be added. Feel free to open an [enhancement issue](https://github.com/rcwdev/emote-showcase/issues) if you have an idea to enhance the emote panel. Keep in mind, this is project is "maintained" by a single person.

- Stream overlay that displays when an emote has been added, with hopes to support all third-party emote platforms.
- Showcase the attributed creator of specific emotes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

Make sure you have created an extension in the [Twitch Developer Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console), it is also recommended to use the [Twitch Developer Rig](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/extensions/rig) to modify the configuration service that Twitch provides.

All that is needed to run to the panel is an HTTP web server. You also need to make sure that your `Testing Base URI` as well as the relative paths to the panel and configuration's html file are set correctly.
