Lt. Wilson's Emote Showcase is an extensive and customizable showcase for all of your emotes. This extension has support for not only your own channel emotes, but also for third-party services such as BetterTTV, FrankerFaceZ, and 7TV. This extension also displays info about the emote, such as the uploader for emotes on third-party services.

Includes support for channel follower emotes, subscriber emotes, animated emotes, BetterTTV channel emotes, BetterTTV shared emotes, FrankerFaceZ emotes, and 7TV emotes.

###### This project is not affiliated with BetterTTV, FrankerFaceZ, or 7TV - I am not a professional, my code is sloppy and could be better.

## Development

It is recommended to use the [Twitch Developer Rig](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/extensions/rig) for some aspects of development, such as modifying extension configuration through Twitch. However, all that is needed to run this project is a web server.
